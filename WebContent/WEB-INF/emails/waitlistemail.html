        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            After careful consideration, we have selected your student _STUDENTNAME_ to be granted wait list status for the following camp: _CAMPNAME_ (_CAMPLEVEL_, _CAMPDATES_).
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">
            We had many applicants this year and unfortunately could not accept every student. If you wish to remain on the wait list, no further action is required. If you have other pending applications, you will receive a separate status update for each application.
            <br><br>
            If you do not wish to be placed on the waiting list, please <a href="https://summercamp.usc.edu/SummerCamp/register.jsp">log in to your account</a> and withdraw your student's application.
            <br><br>
            Please consider registering for one of the paid camps and guaranteeing your student a spot in a camp.
